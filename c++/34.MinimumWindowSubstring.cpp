/*
 76. Minimum Window Substring
Hard
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window 
substring
 of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
Example 2:

Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
Example 3:

Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
 

Constraints:

m == s.length
n == t.length
1 <= m, n <= 105
s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
 

Follow up: Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?

// Algorithm
/*
 Key Concepts
Sliding Window Technique:

We maintain two pointers (left and right) to track the current window in string s.
We expand the window by moving the right pointer and add characters to a frequency map (windowFreq).
Once the window contains all characters from string t, we try to shrink it from the left (left pointer) while maintaining the validity of the window (i.e., it still contains all characters from t).
Hashmaps for Frequency Count:

targetFreq: This hashmap stores the frequency of each character in string t.
windowFreq: This hashmap keeps track of the frequency of characters in the current window of string s.
These maps help in checking whether the current window satisfies the requirements (i.e., contains all characters from t with at least the required frequencies).
Valid Window Check:

The variable formed keeps track of how many unique characters from t have been fully included in the current window.
Once formed == required (i.e., all characters from t are in the window), we try to shrink the window to find the smallest possible window that still contains all characters from t.
Result:

If a valid window is found, we keep track of the smallest window by updating minLength and minWindowStart.
At the end, if no valid window was found, return an empty string. Otherwise, return the substring that represents the smallest window.
